# Piqueaboo — notes for Claude

See `README.md` for site structure, local preview, and deployment.

## Article authorship

On this site, the user writes article prose and originates visual/design
concepts. Claude's role is implementation: code, data pipelines, and
technical execution (scraping, simulation engines, chart mechanics, page
structure/CSS/JS plumbing) — not authoring headings, narrative copy,
captions, or inventing visual treatments on its own. Check with the user
for the actual text and visual direction before drafting either.

## TODO

- `articles/pl-xg-simulator.html` — replaced (2026-08-24) with a new piece
  built around a 1,000,000-simulation treemap of the 2025/26 season, per
  the user's own visual spec (area-proportional treemap, one region per
  champion team, crest centered, click-to-inspect "story" simulations) plus
  a supporting section on Leicester's 2015-16 title (10,000 sims). The old
  article's "simulate it yourself" live client-side widget was re-added
  pointed at the 2025/26 data — `articles/pl-xg-simulator-data.json`
  now holds that season's shots (regenerated via `export_client_data.py`)
  rather than 2024/25's.
  As of 2026-08-24 the user has written the actual commentary for the
  intro (xG explainer + "data information" disclosure), the treemap
  section's framing paragraphs, and the Leicester paragraph — all dropped
  in as real `<p>` copy. Still outstanding, marked `<!-- HEADING: TBD -->`
  (or similar) in the HTML for the user to fill in themselves: the page
  title/h1, the treemap section heading, the simulator section's
  heading/intro copy, and the Leicester section heading. Two inline
  placeholders inside the user's own Leicester paragraph are also still
  theirs to finish: `xx%` (the actual simulated Leicester title odds —
  note the equivalent number is already computed live in
  `#leicester-stats`) and `(insert examples here)`. The treemap intro
  paragraph also still has a literal `20xx/xx` season placeholder.
  `index.html`'s teaser card for this article is still placeholder copy
  and wasn't touched by this pass.

  **2026-08-25, done — genuinely-1,000,000-cell zoomable treemap** (see
  `/root/.claude/plans/purring-finding-badger.md` for the full plan, agreed
  with the user): the "zoom through the treemap" idea above is now a real
  guided flythrough into individually-addressable simulation cells, backed
  by a three-tier save policy on the 1,000,000-sim run (who-won by default;
  full season table when the champion is an "unexpected winner" — real
  position outside the top half; full match detail when a game hits 15+
  total goals or a player scores 6+, the latter capped to one flagged
  instance per real fixture). Both parts are checked in:
  `simulations/export_treemap_data.py`'s big pass writes
  `articles/pl-treemap-data/flagged-champions.json` (2,002 sims) and
  `flagged-games.json` (1,023 sims: 987 high-scoring, 36 deduped 6+-goal
  hauls), each record carrying a real global `sim` index into
  `champions.bin`; `pl-xg-simulator.html`'s treemap script now builds a
  client-side spatial index from that, renders a per-team zoomed-in grid
  (virtualised to the viewport — cost bounded by canvas size, not by how
  many sims a team won) once zoomed in past a threshold, and drives a
  click-to-start guided tour through the most extreme flagged sims with
  play/pause/prev/next/exit controls and an on-demand story modal. Overview
  ↔ grid is a defined crossfade rather than one continuous coordinate
  system, per the user's "simpler zoomed out, detail on zoom in" steer.
  Desktop-first (wheel-zoom/drag-pan); mobile gets the overview, roster
  cards, and tour (camera tweens need no pointer input) but not manual
  grid pan/zoom, per agreed scope. Verified with a real headless-Chromium
  Playwright pass rather than just a syntax check — caught and fixed two
  genuine bugs that inspection alone had missed (an un-deduped itinerary
  that collapsed onto a couple of outlier teams/fixtures, and a CSS
  specificity bug where this page's own `display:flex`/`none` rules beat
  the browser's default `[hidden]{display:none}` at equal specificity, so
  two control clusters and an empty caption bar stayed visibly stuck on).
  The itinerary's captions are auto-generated from the numbers ("Team X win
  the league here — in reality they finished Nth.") — worth the user's own
  pass to hand-tune once they've seen it live, same as the rest of this
  article's copy.
